# What is it?
Name It is a web implementation of Scattergories. Players have three minutes to fill out ten categories with a word starting with a particular letter.

Although this is a multiplayer game,
* you need to speak with other players
* you aren't automatically connected to other players
* each game doesn't know about the others
* you need to coordinate games yourselves (which is why you need to speak with them)

And yet, a game that doesn't know about other players can still manage to be a multiplayer game!
